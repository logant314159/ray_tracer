# ray_tracer

My implementation of a simple raytracer in rust based on [Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
I chose this project to start learning Rust as it seems to cover a lot of the language features, as well as making a visually impressive product.
